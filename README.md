# 👋 Hello, Digital World! I'm M Irfan Riaz

## 🚀 Web Developer | 🎨 UI/UX Enthusiast | 💡 Creative Problem Solver

Crafting pixel-perfect experiences and turning coffee into code. I'm on a mission to make the web a more beautiful and user-friendly place, one line of CSS at a time.

### 🛠️ Tech Toolbox
- Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+), React, GSAP

- Design: Figma, Adobe XD

### 🌟 What I Do
- Transform ideas into intuitive, responsive web applications
- Obsess over user experience and accessibility
- Bridge the gap between design and development
- Solve complex problems with elegant, efficient solutions

### 🎨 UI/UX Philosophy
"Design is not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works." - Steve Jobs

I live by this mantra, creating interfaces that are not only visually stunning but also a joy to use.

### 🌈 Fun Facts
- I can name at least 50 CSS properties in under a minute
- My code is as clean as my coffee is strong
- I dream in flexbox and grid layouts
